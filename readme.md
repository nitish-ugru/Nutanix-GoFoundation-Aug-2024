## Why Go?
- Simplicity
    - ONLY 25 keywords
    - No access modifiers (private/public/protected etc)
    - No classes (only structs)
    - No inheritance (only composition)
    - No reference types (everything is a value in Go)
    - No pointer arithmatic
    - No exceptions (ONLY errors which are just values)
    - No try..catch..finally construct
    - No implicit type conversion
- Cloud Native
- Performance
    - Close to hardware
    - Compile to native code
    - Support for cross compilation
- Concurrency
    - Managed Concurrency (vs OS Thread based)
    - Cheap
    - Concurrency support is built IN the language
        - "go" keyword, "channel" data type, channel "<-" operator, "range" & "select-case" constructs
        - standard library APIs
            - "sync" package
            - "sync/atomic" package
